# Dashboard System - Project Status

## Project Overview
The Dashboard System aims to create a high-performance WebSocket-based dashboard displaying real-time user earnings, network connections, referrals, and rewards. The system is designed to handle millions of concurrent WebSocket connections and will eventually integrate with blockchain technology. The project consists of several components:

1. **WebSocket Server** - Core implementation with Actix-web and WebSocket support
2. **Dashboard Web Interface** - Front-end for visualizing earnings and networks
3. **Network Monitoring System** - Real-time tracking of network connections
4. **Referral Management System** - Handling user referrals and rewards
5. **Blockchain Integration Layer** - For future migration to blockchain-based storage

## Current Phase Details

### Phase 1: Core WebSocket Server (Current)

We're currently implementing the core WebSocket server with the following status:

- **Core Framework**: Implementing architectural design using Actix-web, setting up project structure, and implementing base components.
- **HTTP Layer**: Implementing route definitions and middleware setup for authentication, logging, and CORS.
- **WebSocket Layer**: Implementing connection handling, session management, heartbeat mechanism, and message routing.
- **Handler Layer**: Basic handlers are in place, with ongoing updates to implement service dependency injection.
- **Service Layer**: Service interfaces defined and implementing dependency injection pattern. Implementation progress varies by service:
  - **UserService**: Early implementation (20%) with basic user management and authentication.
  - **NetworkService**: Initial implementation (10%) with basic network tracking.
  - **NotificationService**: Partial implementation (30%) with WebSocket message broadcasting.
  - **EarningsService**: Not yet started.
  - **ReferralService**: Not yet started.
- **Storage Layer**: Defined traits, implementing in-memory storage for testing and development.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing comprehensive error handling system with custom error types and HTTP integration.
- **Configuration**: Implementing configuration module with environment-based settings.
- **Data Models**: Implementing required data models for users, networks, earnings, and referrals.
- **Dependency Flow**: Implementing pattern where storage is injected into services, and services are injected into handlers.

**Progress**: 15% complete

## Architectural Updates

We've updated our architectural approach to better handle millions of concurrent WebSocket connections:

1. **Actor Model for WebSockets**: Using Actix's actor system for efficient WebSocket handling, providing isolated state and concurrent processing.

2. **Dependency Injection Pattern**:
   - Storage instances are created and Arc-wrapped in main.rs
   - Services receive storage in their constructors
   - Handlers receive services via Actix's web::Data

3. **Connection Pooling**: Implementing optimized connection pooling for database and Redis to handle high throughput.

4. **Sharding Strategy**: Planning data sharding to distribute database load for high-volume network data.

5. **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Implementing efficient heartbeat system to detect and clean up stale connections.

6. **Message Broadcasting**: Optimizing notification delivery to minimize overhead when broadcasting to millions of connections.

## Technical Debt/Issues

1. **WebSocket Scaling**: Need to verify the architecture can truly handle millions of concurrent connections.
2. **Database Load**: High-volume data for network connections may cause database bottlenecks.
3. **Redis Configuration**: Need to optimize Redis for connection tracking and caching.
4. **Error Handling**: Need to ensure consistent error response format across all endpoints.
5. **WebSocket Authentication**: Need to implement secure authentication for WebSocket connections.
6. **Service Implementation**: Need to complete service implementations with the new dependency injection pattern.
7. **Testing Infrastructure**: Need comprehensive testing for WebSocket connections at scale.
8. **Monitoring**: Need to implement detailed metrics collection for performance monitoring.
