2. **Dashboard Web Interface** - Front-end for visualizing earnings and networks
3. **Network Monitoring System** - Real-time tracking of network connections
4. **Referral Management System** - Handling user referrals and rewards
5. **Blockchain Integration Layer** - For future migration to blockchain-based storage

**Progress**: 20% complete

## WebSocket Signature Authentication Implementation Plan (New)

We have implemented a secure authentication flow for WebSocket connections using ed25519 signatures:

### 1. Signature Service Implementation
- ✅ Created a new `SignatureService` to handle ed25519 signature verification
- ✅ Implemented methods to verify signatures against stored public keys
- ✅ Added functionality to validate message timestamps and nonces
- ✅ Connected with user storage to look up users by public key

### 2. WebSocket Authentication Message Format
- ✅ Defined `WebSocketAuthMessage` with public key, timestamp, nonce, and signature
- ✅ Implemented serialization/deserialization for auth messages
- ✅ Added validation for message format and content

### 3. WebSocket Session Extension
- ✅ Modified `WebSocketSession` to track authentication state
- ✅ Added user association after successful authentication
- ✅ Implemented secure rejection for unauthenticated connections

### 4. Message Handling Update
- ✅ Updated WebSocket handler to prioritize authentication messages
- ✅ Implemented special handling for the initial authentication flow
- ✅ Added rejection of non-auth messages from unauthenticated clients

### 5. Storage Layer Extension
- ✅ Extended `UserStorage` with methods to find users by public key
- ✅ Implemented public key management functionality
- ❌ Add caching for frequently used public keys (future enhancement)

### 6. Security Enhancements
- ❌ Add rate limiting for authentication attempts (future enhancement)

## WebSocket Authentication Flow Implementation

The WebSocket authentication flow follows this sequence:

1. **Connection Initiation**:
   - ✅ Client connects to WebSocket endpoint
   - ✅ Server creates a new WebSocketSession with `auth_state = AuthState::NotAuthenticated`
   - ✅ Server sends a welcome message requesting authentication

2. **Authentication Message**:
   - ✅ Client sends an authentication message
   - ✅ Message contains: public key, timestamp, nonce, and ed25519 signature
   - ✅ Signature covers the concatenated timestamp and nonce values

3. **Signature Verification**:
   - ✅ `SignatureService` verifies the signature using ed25519-dalek
   - ✅ Looks up the user associated with the public key via UserStorage
   - ✅ Verifies timestamp is recent to prevent replay attacks
   - ✅ Processes nonce for uniqueness

4. **Connection Authorization**:
   - ✅ If verification passes, WebSocketSession is marked as `AuthState::Authenticated`
   - ✅ User ID is associated with the session
   - ✅ Success response sent to client with session ID
   - ✅ If verification fails, appropriate error is sent and connection is closed after a delay

5. **Secure Communication**:
   - ✅ Only authenticated sessions can send/receive regular messages
   - ✅ Unauthenticated messages are rejected with appropriate errors
   - ✅ Messages include user association for backend processing
   - ✅ Heartbeat mechanism maintains connection health

## Technical Debt/Issues

1. **WebSocket Scaling**: Need to verify the architecture can truly handle millions of concurrent connections.
2. **Database Load**: High-volume data for network connections may cause database bottlenecks.
3. **Redis Configuration**: Need to optimize Redis for connection tracking and caching.
4. **Error Handling**: Need to ensure consistent error response format across all endpoints.
5. **WebSocket Authentication**: Currently implementing secure authentication for WebSocket connections using ed25519-dalek.
6. **Service Implementation**: Need to complete service implementations with the new dependency injection pattern.
7. **Testing Infrastructure**: Need comprehensive testing for WebSocket connections at scale.
8. **Monitoring**: Need to implement detailed metrics collection for performance monitoring.
9. **Signature Verification Performance**: Need to optimize cryptographic operations for high-volume connections.
10. **Public Key Management**: Implementing efficient storage and retrieval of public keys.
